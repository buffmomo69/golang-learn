# garbage collection


# syntax
- new()
- make()

# pointers

## why the pointers exist
- problem
    - some times you passon the function and *copies* is being passed on to the function to avoid these we have pointer
    - ensures that the whatever you are passing on is the actual value you passed in
    - refrence means "&"
